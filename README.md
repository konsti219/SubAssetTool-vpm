# Sub Asset Tool for VRChat package manager

This tool allows editing of the sub assets (or objects) contained within a single asset file on disk.

For easier browsing and installation visit the [GitHub Pages Site](https://konsti219.github.io/vcc-tools/).

## Use cases

- Organise your files by keeping related assets in one main asset.
  For example you can include the animations that a blendtree uses in the blendtree asset.
  This also avoids cluttering your folders with too many files because you can hide all the sub assets easily.

  You can use this tool to extract the blendtree.
